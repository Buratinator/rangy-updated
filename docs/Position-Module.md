# Position Module (ABANDONED)

This module adds methods to Range and Selection objects that provide pixel coordinates of the start or end of the range or selection, relative to either the viewport or the document, and objects representing the bounding rectangle for the whole range or selection (again, relative to either the viewport or the document).

The complications involved in making this module work properly in all situations are such that I now consider them outside the scope of Rangy and this module is now abandoned. The source file will remain in the repository for anyone who may find a use for it.
